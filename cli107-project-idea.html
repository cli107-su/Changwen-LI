    <p> My theme is the type of coffee. During school, I often try different coffee. Latte, American coffee and cappuccino are the types I drink regularly. I have learned about some coffee before. I learned that different coffees are produced by coffee beans of different origins and different production methods. 
    In my individual project, I will use multimedia to show people the mystery of coffee. I plan to get information and pictures about coffee from Google. At the same time, I will select some videos from youtube to help readers understand.</p>
